This is the Task Manager requested by your company for a coding test.

It depends on the user having a database to commit data to. I've attached an SQL file with the required structure. Once that is executed, you will also need to create a user with the following attributes and, of course, editing privileges for the database.

The user name is: taskadmin
And the password: simple_english
